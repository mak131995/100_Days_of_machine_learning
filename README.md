# 100 Days of Machine Learning

Welcome to my "100 Days of Machine Learning" challenge repository! This is where I document my journey of learning and mastering machine learning over the course of 100 days. Whether you're a beginner or have some prior experience, I hope this repository will serve as a source of inspiration and progress tracking.

## Overview

Machine learning is a dynamic and exciting field with applications ranging from image recognition to natural language processing. This challenge is designed to provide a structured path for learning and hands-on experience.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork this Repository**: Start by forking this repository to your GitHub account. You can use this repository to showcase your progress and projects to the community.

2. **Daily Commitment**: I commit to dedicating at least 1-2 hours every day for the next 100 days to study and practice machine learning. Consistency is the key to success.

3. **Programming Language**: I've chosen python as my primary language for machine learning. However, feel free to use any language that suits your preferences.

4. **Environment Setup**: My development environment includes  Python, Jupyter Notebook, etc.

## Daily Tasks

In the "daily_tasks" directory, you'll find a new task for each day. These tasks may include:

- Reading articles or research papers.
- Watching video tutorials.
- Coding exercises and mini-projects.

I will diligently complete these tasks and commit my work to this repository to track my progress and share my journey with others.

## Projects

Throughout the challenge, I'll be working on various machine learning projects, starting with simpler ones and gradually tackling more complex tasks. These projects will help me apply what I've learned and build a portfolio of machine learning work.

## Collaboration

I'm open to collaborating with fellow learners taking on this challenge. Machine learning often benefits from collaboration, and I'll actively seek opportunities to work on projects and seek assistance when needed.

## Sharing My Progress

I will share my daily progress and experiences on social media platforms using the hashtag #100DaysOfMLChallenge. It's a great way to connect with others, receive feedback, and stay motivated throughout the journey.

## Staying Informed

To stay updated with the latest developments in machine learning, I'll follow blogs, forums, and relevant news sources. Keeping up with the latest techniques and breakthroughs is essential in this dynamic field.

## Disclaimer

I understand that learning machine learning is a continuous journey filled with challenges and setbacks. I am committed to overcoming these hurdles and never ceasing my pursuit of knowledge and expertise in machine learning.

Let's embark on this incredible 100-day journey to master machine learning together! ðŸš€
